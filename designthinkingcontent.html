         <body>Vietnam only ranks 47th in the global tourism ranking despite its flourishing technological advancements (Tourism in Vietnam, 2020). To increase the awareness of it having a high socio-economic status, Singaporean Youths between 18 and 35 can be targeted. They are ideal since they care most about trendiness when traveling (Asan, 2020). They are also savvy with technology, which makes information dissemination less resource intensive. Thus, five user interviews can be done to discover how they feel about traveling in Ho Chi Min, Vietnam and how to improve these sentiments. 
        <p></p>
        </body>
        <h4>Target Audience</h4>
        <p></p>
        <body>This will include those who have not been to Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam before and are Singaporean Youths between 18 and 35. They are segmented by race (3 Chinese, 1 Malay, 1 Indian)and gender (3 male, 2 female) to ensure a representative sample.

            <h4>User Research Method: In-depth Interview</h4>
            <p></p>
            <body>
              Since the broad issue pertains to why Youths do not visit Ho Chi Minh, and how to fix this, in-depth interviews can be held. This addresses the problem as it captures users' attitudes through what they say.
              <p></p> 
              Interviews through Zoom were conducted, and participants' voices were recorded. They lasted 20 minutes each. 
            <p></p>    
            An interview guide was used to navigate the interview. It started with an introduction to the project's purpose and getting consent to record the interview. The questions start with general ones to ease participants into the interview. This is followed by sections based on the AIDA model, which enables the tracking of customer journeys.

             <body>
            <p></p>
                I used Google Sheets to organise the most important insights. Below is an excerpt.

            <h4>Persona</h4>
            <p></p>
            <body>I created a persona based on the sample I interviewed: Inquisitive Ian is a Chinese 23-year-old male. He is a full-time student and travels yearly to Asian countries. He has a large budget to spend given that he comes from a double-income household and works part-time. He seeks unique, up-to-date experiences when traveling. His preferred mode of learning about travel is through user-generated content on social media and on Google.   
            <p></p>
             </body>
             <h4>User Journey</h4>
            <p></p>
            <body>This shows my findings through Ian's perspective. It shows what he does, thinks, says and feels at different stages of finding out more about Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's destinations online.

            <body>   
            Singaporean Youths need a way to stay engaged when learning about Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam because they are exposed to a lot of travel content online.

            <h1>Step 4: Prototype</h1>
            <p></p>
            <h4>High-fidelity prototype</h4>
            <p></p>
             <body>
                The prototype is a microsite with four pages. I used Wix to conceptualise it as I wanted the prototype to be interactive such that participants can test it in Step 5. I made it with Jakob's Ten Usability Heuristics to ensure the microsite is usable. You can access the prototype <a href="https://nujiyhol.wixsite.com/website" class="link-dark">here</a>. 
            <p></p>
            </body>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Page 1: Homepage</h4>
            <p></p>
            <body>
                Users feel frustrated about finding trending destinations across travel categories like accomodations. They also trust user-generated content most. To reduce the time needed for them to access these categories, the homepage features my own trending travel recommendations across popular categories, supported by ratings from the review platform Trip Advisor. 
                <p></p>
                Heuristic 3: User control and freedom is preserved since I ensure that the clickable buttons open pages on another tab. This way, users can go back to the page they were at without disruption. 
                <p></p>
                Heuristic 6: I added 'Contact Me', 'Gallery' and 'Book Now' buttons throughout the page so that users can immediately access these options while reading instead of using the top navigation bar exclusively to avoid making users remember information. Each type of button has a distinct colour and are worded the same way to encourage recognition. 
                
            <p></p>
            </body>
            <img src="images/revamped 4.png" width="800" height="600" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
            <p></p>
            <h4>Sub-page 2: Contact Me</h4>
            <p></p>
            <body>
                To easily enable users to send their queries to me, I added this page with my e-mail and a space to send messages to me directly. 
                <p></p>
                Heuristic 5: Error prevention is included in the form of including prompts for where users are supposed to fill in their name, email, country, and feedback. 
                <p></p>
                Heuristic 9: They are required to fill in all fields when sending queries, if not, prompts will apear. These error messages ensure that users can recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors easily. 
            <p></p>

            <h4>Sub-page 3: Gallery</h4>
            <p></p>
            <body>
                To give users a more in-depth look at my recommendations, I included more pictures I took along with respective captions. The pictures autoplay to encourage users to swipe through the pictures.
                <p></p>
                Heuristic 4: I organised them according to the locations from the homepage, with the same wording. This is to ensure consistency by following platform conventions.
                <p></p>
                Heuristic 8: Aesthetic and minimalist design was included through the 'accordian' design whereby not all sections are open when the user accesses the page. They have the option to open each section if they find them relevant. This is to ensure that users do not get overwhelmed by information not relevant to them.

            <h4>Individual Usability Test (UT)</h4>
             <body>
                I hosted another round of Zoom meetings. This time, I asked the same participants to share their screens while I screen-recorded. I gave them two tasks to execute on the prototype. Results were low on severity, which meant that minimal changes had to be made to the prototype before implementation.   
            <p></p>
            </body>
            <img src="images/Task 1 actual.png" width="800" height="600" class="img-fluid" alt="...">

            <p></p>
            <h4>Co-creation</h4>
            <p></p>
             <body>
                Besides asking users to execute the tasks, I also asked them if the site navigation can be improved. With regards to Task 1, three of five users mentioned that they would rather directly get a recommendation tailored to their needs instead of scrolling through all the categories. Thus, I included a segment at the top of the homepage to direct users to a recommendation that would suit them most based on what they are feeling. 
                <p></p>
                Heuristic 2: This addition increased the match between system and the real world as instead of simply giving the technical names of travel categories, I tailored them to words users use more often. (e.g. instead of 'night life', users can click on 'I'm looking for somewhere to go late at night')

                         <body>
                            I used Visual Code Studio to piece the microsite together. There, I used HTML to create the overall structure and include drop down lists. I then used Bootstrap 5 to make the pages responsive to small, medium and large webpages. I used JQuery to link the pages together, to make the Contact Me page create error messages, and to create the accordian on the Gallery page. I then used CSS to centre words, change fonts and font sizes to create a sleek aesthetic.
